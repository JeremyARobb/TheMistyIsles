TheMistyIsles

  The Misty Isles is a fantasy world that takes place after an event called 'the great extinction' in where all humans went extinct along with MOST big animals (like cheetahs or bears). The world is dominated by small creatures such as moles and rats and bunnies, any sort of small animal you can think of, they are deemed the former, meaning animals that were in the world before all the big animals were wiped out; however, there are animals that appeared after the humans went extinct aswell, such as bristles, murlocs, and whelps. they coexist with each other to an extent, there are often wars that plague the land, both former and subsequents believing themselves the better race, and therefore attempt to take control over key cities. You come in starting as either a former or a subsequent (you choose) and that choice will guide your way of seeing the world, the quests you get, your starting zone, but from there, you make the decisions.
